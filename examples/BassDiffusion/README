Simulation model Bass Diffusion as described in the documentation
of AnyLogic in the part related to the agent-based modelling.

The model describes a product diffusion process. Potential 
adopters of a product are influenced into buying the product 
by advertising and by word of mouth from adopters, those 
who have already purchased the new product. Adoption of 
a new product driven by word of mouth is likewise an epidemic. 
Potential adopters come into contact with adopters through 
social interactions. A fraction of these contacts results 
in the purchase of the new product. The advertising causes 
a constant fraction of the potential adopter population 
to adopt each time period.
