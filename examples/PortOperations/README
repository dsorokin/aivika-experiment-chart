Example: Port Operations

It is described in different sources [1, 2]. So, this is chapter 12 of [2] and section 6.13 of [1].

A port in Africa is used to load tankers with crude oil for overwater shipment.
The port has facilities for loading as many as three tankers simultaneously.
The  tankers, which arrive at the port every 11 +/- 7 hours, are of three different
types. The relative frequency of the various types, and their loading time
requirements, are as follows:

Type      Relative Frequency      Loading Time, Hours
  1              0.25                   18 +/- 2
  2              0.55                   24 +/- 3
  3              0.20                   36 +/- 4

There is one tug at the port. Tankers of all types require the services of this tug
to move into a berth, and later to move out of a berth. When the tug is available,
any berthing or de-berthing activity takes about one hour. Top priority is given to
the berthing activity.

A shipper is considering bidding on a contract to transport oil from the port to
the United Kingdom. He has determined that 5 tankers of a particular type would
have to be committed to this task to meet contract specifications. These tankers
would require 21 +/- 3 hours to load oil at the port. After loading and de-berthing,
they would travel to the United Kingdom, offload the oil, and return to the port for
reloading. Their round-trip travel time, including offloading, is estimated to be
240 +/- hours.

A complicated factor is that the port experiences storms. The time between
the onset of storms is exponentially distributed with a mean of 48 hours and a.
storm lasts 4 +/- 2 hours. No tug can start an operation until a storm is over.

Before the port authorities can commit themselves to accommodating the
proposed 5 tankers, the effect of the additional port traffic on the in-port residence
time of the current port users must be determined. It is desired to simulate the
operation of the port for a one-year period (= 8640 hours) under the proposed new
commitment to measure in-port residence time of the proposed additional tankers,
as well as the three types of tankers which already use the port. All durations
given as ranges are uniformly distributed.
