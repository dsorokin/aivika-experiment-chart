Example: In this example, the operations of a quarry are modeled.

It is described in different sources [1, 2]. So, this is chapter 10 of [2] and section 5.16 of [1].

In this example, the operations of a quarry are modeled. In the quarry,
trucks deliver ore from three shovels to a crusher. A truck always
returns to its assigned shovel after dumping a load at the crusher.
There are two different truck sizes in use, twenty-ton and fifty-ton.
The size of the truck affects its loading time at the shovel, travel
time to the crusher, dumping time at the crusher and return trip time
from the crusher back to the appropriate shovel. For the twenty-ton
trucks, there loading, travel, dumping and return trip times are:
exponentially distributed with a mean 5; a constant 2.5; exponentially
distributed with mean 2; and a constant 1.5. The corresponding times
for the fifty-ton trucks are: exponentially distributed with mean 10;
a constant 3; exponentially distributed with mean 4; and a constant 2.
To each shovel is assigned two twenty-ton trucks are one fifty-ton truck.
The shovel queues are all ranked on a first-in, first-out basis.
The crusher queue is ranked on truck size, largest trucks first.
It is desired to analyze this system over 480 time units to determine
the utilization and queue lengths associated with the shovels and crusher.
