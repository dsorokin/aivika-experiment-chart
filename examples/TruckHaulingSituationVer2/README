Example: A Truck Hauling Situation (A More Complete Version).

It is described in different sources [1, 2]. So, this is chapter 9 of [2] and section 7.16 of [1].

The system to be modeled in this example consists of one bulldozer, four trucks,
and two man-machine loaders. The bulldozer stockpiles material for the loaders.
Two piles of material must be stocked prior to the initiation of any load operation.
The time for the bulldozer to stockpile material is Erlang distributed and consists
of the sum of two exponential variables each with a men of 4. (This corresponds to
an Erlang variable with a mean of 8 and a variance of 32.) In addition to this
material, a loader and an unloaded truck must be available before the loading
operations can begin. Loading time is exponentially distributed with a mean time of
14 minutes for server 1 and 12 minutes for server 2.

After a truck is loaded, it is hauled, then dumped and must be returned before
the truck is available for further loading. Hauling time is normally distributed.
When loaded, the average hauling time is 22 minutes. When unloaded, the average
time is 18 minutes. In both cases, the standard deviation is 3 minutes. Dumping
time is uniformly distributed between 2 and 8 minutes. Following a loading
operation, the loaded must rest for a 5 minute period before he is available
to begin loading again. The system is to be analyzed for 8 hours and all operations
in progress at the end of 8 hours should be completed before terminating
the operations for a run.
