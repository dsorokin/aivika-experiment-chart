Example: Inspection and Adjustment Stations on a Production Line
 
This is a model of the workflow with a loop. Also there are two infinite queues.

It is described in different sources [1, 2]. So, this is chapter 8 of [2] and section 5.15 of [1].

Assembled television sets move through a series of testing stations in the final 
stage of their production. At the last of these stations, the vertical control 
setting on the TV sets is tested. If the setting is found to be functioning improperly, 
the offending set is routed to an adjustment station where the setting is adjusted. 
After adjustment, the television set is sent back to the last inspection station where 
the setting is again inspected. Television sets passing the final inspection phase, 
whether for the first time of after one or more routings through the adjustment station, 
are routed to a packing area.

The time between arrivals of television sets to the final inspection station is uniformly 
distributed between 3.5 and 7.5 minutes. Two inspectors work side-by-side at the final 
inspection station. The time required to inspect a set is uniformly distributed between 
6 and 12 minutes. On the average, 85 percent of the sets pass inspection and continue on
the packing department. The other 15 percent are routed to the adjustment station which is
manned by a single worker. Adjustment of the vertical control setting requires between 20
and 40 minutes, uniformly distributed.

The inspection station and adjustor are to be simulated for 480 minutes to estimate 
the time to process television sets through the final production stage and to determine 
the utilization of the inspectors and the adjustors.
