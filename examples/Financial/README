This financial model is described in Vensim 5 Modeling Guide, Chapter Financial Modeling and Risk.

It illustrates how you can use the Monte-Carlo simulation and define external parameters 
for the system of recursive diffential equations to provide the Sensitivity Analysis. 

To enable the parallel simulation, you should compile it with option -threaded and 
then pass in other options +RTS -N2 -RTS to the executable if you have a dual core 
processor without hyper-threading. Also you can increase the number of parallel threads 
via option -N if you have a more modern processor.
